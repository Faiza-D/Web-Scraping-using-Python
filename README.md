# Web Scraping with Python

üöÄ **Web Scraping using Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium** üï∏Ô∏è

## Overview
This repository contains my journey into web scraping with Python. Using powerful tools like Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, I explore various techniques to scrape and extract data from websites‚Äîboth static and dynamic content.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Requests**: To send HTTP requests and fetch webpage data.
- **BeautifulSoup**: To parse HTML documents and extract information.
- **Selenium**: To handle dynamic content, JavaScript, and automate browser interactions.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and run the code in a structured, interactive environment.
- **Microsoft Edge**: As the automated browser for Selenium.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary libraries: 
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
How to Use
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Open the Jupyter notebook (web_scraping_notebook.ipynb) to view the learning and practice code.

Run the code to explore how different libraries handle web scraping tasks:
Fetching static content using Requests.
Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup.
Scraping dynamic websites with Selenium.
Example Scripts

Each section in the Jupyter Notebook covers practical examples, including:

Basic HTTP Requests: Fetching page content using Requests.
HTML Parsing: Extracting data from static pages using BeautifulSoup.
Dynamic Content Scraping: Automating browser interactions with Selenium for JavaScript-rendered pages.
